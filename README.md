# Snake-and-ladder

In this code, we first define the positions of the snakes and ladders as dictionaries. We then define a function to roll the dice and another function to move the player's position based on the dice roll.

We then start the game with a while loop that continues until one of the players reaches position 100. In each iteration of the loop, we get the dice roll for player 1 and move their position. We then do the same for player 2. If either player reaches position 100, we print a message declaring them the winner and break out of the loop.
